# Deploying Lifeline Services on Docker: A Comprehensive Guide

## Introduction

This user manual provides step-by-step instructions for deploying Lifeline services using Docker. By following these guidelines, you can set up and run Lifeline services efficiently and ensure a seamless deployment process. Lifeline is a critical application, and Docker simplifies its deployment, making it easier to manage dependencies and ensure consistency across different environments.

## Prerequisites

Before you proceed with deploying Lifeline services on Docker, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

1. **Docker**: Docker is a containerization platform that allows you to package and distribute applications and their dependencies as containers. Download and install Docker for your operating system from the official Docker website.

2. **Git**: Git is a version control system used to track changes in the source code during software development. Install Git on your system to clone the Lifeline deployment repository and pull the latest code updates.

## Deployment Steps

Follow these detailed steps to successfully deploy Lifeline services on Docker:

### 1. Clone the Lifeline Deployment Repository

If you haven't already cloned the Lifeline deployment repository, follow these steps:

Open your terminal and enter the following command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:UP-SITAW/lifeline-deployment.git
```

### 2. Pull Latest Code Updates

Before deploying, make sure you have the latest code updates from the repository. Navigate to the cloned repository's directory and run the following command:

```bash
git pull origin master
```

### 3. Create Docker Volumes

Lifeline services require Docker volumes for MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and Hapi. If these volumes haven't been created yet, use the following commands:

- Create a Docker volume for MongoDB:

```bash
docker volume create mongo-db
```

- Create a Docker volume for PostgreSQL:

```bash
docker volume create postgres-data
```

- Create a Docker volume for Hapi:

```bash
docker volume create hapi-data
```

### 4. Run Lifeline Services

Now it's time to start the Lifeline services using Docker Compose. Run the following command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command launches the Lifeline services in detached mode, allowing them to run in the background.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you've successfully deployed Lifeline services using Docker. This deployment method offers flexibility, scalability, and ease of management. Remember that Lifeline is a crucial application, and a well-executed deployment ensures its availability and reliability for users who depend on its services.

For troubleshooting, advanced configurations, and updates, refer to the official Lifeline documentation and Docker documentation. Happy deploying!
